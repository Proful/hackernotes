Idea:-

While reading article, I want to remember few lines. And add some comments of mine.
So that I can later review them.

So this is a Chrome Extension. Why Chrome??? bcoz I use this browser must of time.

Installation
1. Either git clone the repos or download it. Store the "hackernotes" folder some where.
2. in Chrome
Tools > Extensions
Click the "Load unpacked extension" and point to the hackernotes folder. 
done!!

Now when you select a line while reading article. An annoying popup will appear.
just type what ever you wish in the text area and submit.

Go check the notes in
